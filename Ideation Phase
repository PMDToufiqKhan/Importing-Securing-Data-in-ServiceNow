Project Title: Importing & Securing Data in ServiceNow

Problem Statement:
Organizations using ServiceNow often face challenges in managing training data efficiently. Manual entry and lack of structured access controls lead to data inconsistency, 
security risks, and reduced operational efficiency.

Project Objective:
This project aims to automate the process of importing employee training data into ServiceNow, linking it to user records for seamless reporting, and applying access controls 
using ACLs and roles to ensure only authorized personnel can view or modify the data.
