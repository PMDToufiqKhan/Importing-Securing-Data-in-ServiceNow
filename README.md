# Importing-Securing-Data-in-ServiceNow
Linking each record to an employee and pulling some employee details (like department) into the record for easier reporting

This repository contains the report for a ServiceNow project that demonstrates the process of importing employee training records and securing access to sensitive data through ACLs and role-based controls.

The report outlines the step-by-step implementation of key ServiceNow features including:

- Creating a custom table
- Importing data using Import Sets and Transform Maps
- Using Dot-Walking to access related data
- Creating Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict data visibility
- Managing user roles and permissions
- Testing the final setup via impersonation
